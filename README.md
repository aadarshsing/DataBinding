# Data Binding Concept App  

This repository demonstrates the **Data Binding** concept in Android, including both **one-way data binding** and **two-way data binding**. The app serves as a practical example to understand and implement these features in real-world applications.  

## Features  
- **One-Way Data Binding:** Automatically update the UI when the underlying data changes.  
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Synchronize data changes between the UI and the underlying data model seamlessly.  
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation of data binding concepts.  

## What is Data Binding?  
Data Binding is an Android Jetpack library that binds UI components in your XML layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically. This results in less boilerplate code and improved efficiency.  

### Key Advantages:  
- Reduces code complexity by linking UI components directly with the data source.  
- Simplifies UI updates.  
- Enhances app performance with minimal runtime overhead.  

## Whatâ€™s Covered?  
### 1. **One-Way Data Binding**  
- Data flows **from the model to the view**.  
- Example: Updating a `TextView` with user information when the user data model changes.  

### 2. **Two-Way Data Binding**  
- Data flows **both ways**, from the view to the model and vice versa.  
- Example: Binding an `EditText` to a ViewModel so that changes in the EditText update the ViewModel and vice versa.
